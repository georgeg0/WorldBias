This project is inspired from the data visualization featured in Washigton Post on how impicit racial bias vary across United States. The data from IAT is collected for years from 2003 - 2015 with a total of 430k data points. After the data munging, map is drawn for both Europe and World to visualize these datapoints to see how implicit racial bias vary across Europe and when considering the entire world.

spss file need to be downloaded from https://osf.io/52qxl/ for each individual year from 2004 to 2015

To switch between maps, “EUROPE” draws Europe map and “WORLD” draws world map. These change need to be added to WorldBias.R
